            <h1>What Is a Share Market?</h1>
            <p>
              A share market is a place where shares are publicly issued and traded. A share serves
              as a document that validates your ownership in a company, and you can sell this
              document to others. A share market is a place where buyers and sellers meet for this
              exchange of documents. To facilitate the exchange publicly, a formal marketplace has
              been developed for investors to buy and sell their shares on.

            <h1>What is a Share?</h1>
            <p>
              In simple words, a share indicates a unit of ownership of the particular company. If
              you are a shareholder of a company, it implies that you as an investor, hold a
              percentage of ownership of the issuing company. As a shareholder you stand to benefit
              in the event of the company’s profits, and also bear the disadvantages of the
              company’s losses. Shares are also known as stocks, equity, scrips etc. After
              purchasing them you will be known as a stockholder or a shareholder of the company.

            <h1>Why shares?</h1>
            <p>
              All companies need money to run their business. Sometimes the profit acquired from
              selling goods or services is not sufficient to meet the working capital requirements.
              And so, companies invite normal people like you and me to put some money in their
              company so that they can run it efficiently and in return investors get a share of
              whatever profit they make.

            <h1>Difference b/w share market and stock market?</h1>
            <p>
              The key difference between share markets and stock markets is that the former only
              allows one to trade shares. The latter allows you to trade in financial instruments
              such as derivatives, bonds, mutual funds, as well as the shares of listed companies.

              We cannot discuss stock market basics without addressing the key financial instruments
              that are traded on it. There are four categories of financial instruments traded on
              the stock exchange. They are shares, bonds, derivatives, and mutual funds. They are as
              follows:
            </p>

            <p>
              <b> Shares: </b> A share is a single unit of ownership in a company or financial asset
            </p>
            <p>
              <b> Bonds: </b> A bond is loan from an investor to a borrower such as a company or
              government
            </p>
            <p>
              <b> Mutual funds: </b> A mutual fund is a company that brings together money from many
              people and invests it in stocks, bonds or other assets
            </p>
            <p>
              <b> Derivatives: </b> A derivative is a contract between two parties which derives its
              value/price from an underlying asset

              Now that we understand the stock market meaning, one key aspect of stock market basics
              is that one can trade on one of two market segments. In other words, there are two
              types of share markets in India. These are primary markets and secondary markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              A primary share market is a place where a company first gets registered with the goal
              of raising money and issues a certain amount of shares. The goal of being publicly
              listed on a primary stock exchange is to raise money. This where a company gets
              registered to issue a certain amount of shares and raise money. If the company decides
              to sell its shares for the first time, this is known as an initial public offering.
